    <h1>Hi, I&#x27;m <span class="name">Tom&#xE1;s Tapia</span></h1>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for software engineering, and
      there&#39;s nothing quite like the thrill of developing high-performance
      web applications, services, and solutions. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to
      gain experience working with agile methodologies - it&#39;s really
      transformed the way I approach projects, making everything more
      streamlined and adaptive. At the moment, I&#39;m diving headfirst into a
      whole lot of interesting stuff. I&#39;ve set my sights on the CKAD
      certification and I&#39;m really getting stuck into the big three cloud
      platforms: AWS, GCP, and Azure. I&#39;m putting a lot of effort into
      mastering multi-cloud strategies and getting to grips with the
      cloud-native approach - it&#39;s a bit like learning a new language, but
      I&#39;m getting there! I&#39;m also finding serverless architecture
      pretty fascinating. It&#39;s remarkable how taking servers out of the
      equation can open up so many new possibilities! When it comes to
      programming languages and frameworks, I&#39;ve dabbled in quite a few.
      I&#39;m handy with Golang, Java complemented with SpringBoot, Node.js,
      and TypeScript. I&#39;ve also been tinkering around with Nest.js, and
      having a blast creating engaging user interfaces with Vue.js and
      Angular. I&#39;ve had the privilege of working as a cloud solutions
      architect and it&#39;s been an incredible learning experience. Designing
      and implementing complex, scalable cloud infrastructures has given me a
      deep understanding of various cloud models. I&#39;m eager to use this
      knowledge to continue creating robust, efficient solutions that really
      make a difference. So there you have it - I&#39;m just a humble software
      engineer with a curiosity for the cloud, always on the lookout for new
      things to learn and new ways to grow!
